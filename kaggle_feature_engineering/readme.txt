Lesson 1: What is Feature Engineering?

- determine which features are the most important with mutual information
- invent new features in several real-world problem domains
- encode high-cardinality categoricals with a target encoding
- create segmentation features with k-means clustering
- decompose a dataset's variation into features with principal component analysis

A Guiding Principle of Feature Engineering
For a feature to be useful, it must have a relationship to the target that your model is able to learn. Linear models, for instance, are only able to learn linear relationships. So, when using a linear model, your goal is to transform the features to make their relationship to the target linear.

The key idea here is that a transformation you apply to a feature becomes in essence a part of the model itself.
